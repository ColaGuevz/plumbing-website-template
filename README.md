## üé® Customization

1.  **Content:**
    *   Edit `index.html` to change text content, company name, phone numbers, address, service details, testimonials, etc.
    *   Look for placeholder text like `[Year]`, `(123) 456-7890`, etc.

2.  **Styling (Colors, Fonts):**
    *   Open `css/style.css`.
    *   Modify the CSS variables defined within the `:root` block at the top of the file to easily change the primary color (`--primary-color`), accent color (`--accent-color`), fonts (`--font-family`), etc., throughout the site.

3.  **Images:**
    *   Replace the placeholder images in the `images/` folder with your own.
    *   Refer to the comments in `index.html` and the folder structure list above for suggested image types and dimensions.
    *   **Recommended Sources:** Unsplash, Pexels (for photos), Flaticon, Font Awesome (for icons).
    *   **Optimization:** Ensure your images are optimized for the web (use tools like TinyPNG or Squoosh).

4.  **Google Maps:**
    *   Go to Google Maps, find your business location.
    *   Click "Share" -> "Embed a map".
    *   Copy the HTML `<iframe>` code provided.
    *   Paste this code into the `.map-container` div within the Contact section (`#contact`) in `index.html`, replacing the placeholder `<iframe>`.

5.  **Contact Form:**
    *   The provided form in `index.html` is front-end only. To receive submissions, you'll need to:
        *   Add server-side code (PHP, Node.js, Python, etc.) to process the form data.
        *   OR use a third-party form service like Netlify Forms, Formspree, Getform, etc. Update the `<form>` tag's `action` and `method` attributes accordingly.
